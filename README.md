# Highly Available NodeJs App Connected to MongoDB on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

![Architecture](/Images/Architecture.png)

In this project I will deploy a simple Node.js web application **(stateless)** that interacts with a highly available MongoDB **(stateful)** replicated across **3 zones** and consisting of 1 primary and 2 secondaries.

Notes:
- Only the **Management VM (private)** will have access to internet through the **NAT**.
- The **GKE cluster (private)** will NOT have access to the internet.
- The **Management VM** will be used to manage the **GKE cluster** and **build/push** images to the **Artifact Registry**.
- All deployed images must be stored in Artifact Registry.

----------
## Requirements
- **Terraform** is installed on your machine.
- GCP Account with **Billing Activated**.
- Service Account with **Project Owner Access** for Terraform (Create it manually through GCP webUI, then download **json key** for this SA to use it in Terraform).
![TF Service Account](/Images/SA.png)
- Enable **Service Usage API** in GCP for Terraform to be able to communicate with GCP || **[Service Usage API Activation Link](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/serviceusage.googleapis.com)**.
- Create a Project in GCP and get its ID.

----------
## Steps
1. Clone this repo.

    ```Shell
    git clone https://github.com/Ziad-Tawfik/NodeJs-MongoDB-on-Google-Kubernetes-Engine-GKE-.git
    ```

2. Open dev.tfvars to replace the following variables's data with yours using sed command as mentioned below:
    - **Project ID**
    - Path to **SA Json Key** file that you created and downloaded before.
    - **Optionally:** Artifact Repo ID or Regions & Zones of Subnets & VMs 
    > ! Note that changing project id, artifact repo id, region or zone then you will have to modify other files and replace all the old names with the new ones using sed command as below or any other utility.
    
    ```Bash
    find /path/to/repo/folder -type f -exec sed -i 's/old-text/new-text/g' {} \;
    ```

3. Open Bash shell in the cloned repo folder.

4. Execute the below commands to let terraform build the infrastructure.
    ```Shell
    terraform init
    terraform apply --var-file dev.tfvars
    ```
5. Review terraform plan and enter (y) if all is good.

6. Authenticate Google Cloud on your machine using account has admin access if you want to access the management vm from your terminal, 
    > Skip steps 6,7 if you are going to login to the management vm from GCP webUI.

    ```Shell
    gcloud init
    ```
7. After terraform creating the infrastructure, ssh into the management vm using below command with **your project id and vm zone** or from **GCP webUI**.
    ```Shell
    gcloud compute ssh --zone "vm-zone" "management-vm" --tunnel-through-iap --project "your-project-id"
    ```
8. Change directory to **simple-node-app** and execute the **run.sh** which will:
    - **Build** the **docker images** for nodejs, mongodb.
    - **Push** them to your **GCP artifact registery**.
    - **Create** all kubernetes deployment, statefulset, secret and services.

    > Note: You  can change the password of the **root login to the mongodb admin db** by modifying **mongokey.yaml** in this path **/simple-node-app/mongokey.yaml**, and edit the mongodb-root-password with your password encoded in base64 before executing the **run.sh**.

   ```Shell
    cd /simple-node-app;
    source run.sh
   ```

9. Check **Load Balancer External IP** and open it using web browser to check if there is a counter or not.
    ```Shell
    kubectl get svc
   ```
   ![Load Balancer External IP](/Images/External-ip.png)
   ![Counter in Browser](/Images/webbrowser1.png)

10. Each time you refresh the page or a new client accessed the IP will increase the number of visits.

11. We can verify the high availability of the infrastructure by taking down any pod of mongodb and check if the same IP has the same number of visits as before and increased by one.
    ```Shell
    kubectl delete pod mongo-0
    ```
    ![Before Deletion](/Images/pod1.png)
    ![After Deletion](/Images/pod2.png)
    ![Counter in Browser after deletion](/Images/webbrowser2.png)

12. To destroy the infrastructure, execute the below command.

    ```Shell
    terraform destroy --var-file dev.tfvars
    ```

## What Happens Behind-The-Scenes‚ùì
- **Terraform** will Create ***two service account***, one for the ***Management vm*** and the other one for the ***GKE cluster*** with the required permissions.

    ![Created SAs](/Images/Created_SA.png)

- Set up a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**, configure **two Subnets**, establish a **NAT Gateway** for **outbound Internet** access, define a **Firewall Rule** to enable **IAP (Identity-Aware Proxy)** access to the management virtual machine, and create an **Artifact Registry** to store Docker images.

    ![Firewall 3](/Images/allow-iap-firewall-3.png)
    ![Artifact Registery](/Images/Artifact-Repo.png)

- Provision a **Management virtual machine**, deploy a **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** cluster with a **node pool**, and associate **two service accounts** with them.

    ![GKE Cluster](/Images/Kubernetes-Cluster.png)


- Startup script in the Management vm will clone this repo and create all required files in under ***/simple-node-app*** directory. 
    - üå≥ Files tree layout.

    ![VM /simple-node-app tree](/Images/Vm-Tree.png)

- Executing **run.sh** located in **/simple-node-app** in the **management vm**, the following actions are performed:

    - Authenticate Artifact Registery and GKE on the management vm.
    
    - Build docker images: **NodeJs**, **MongoDB**, **MongoDB Sidecar** (which facilitates automatic MongoDB configuration).

        ![Run 1](/Images/Run1.png)

    - Push the created images to the Artifact Registery.

        ![Run 2](/Images/Run2.png)

    - Apply all yaml files found under **/simple-node-app/kube** to the GKE
